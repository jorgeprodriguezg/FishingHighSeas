Network between fishing provinces and grid cells with at least one port located within them. Each row corresponds to a different grid cell. 

Weights Ei represent, for each port, the associated fishing effort, measured in days, in province i. These weights are computed when the port has been either the origin or the destination of the trip to the fishing province i.

The column ET represents the total effort of the port, including the effort in the 14 fishing provinces, but also in other high seas grid cells that are not classified within these main provinces.
