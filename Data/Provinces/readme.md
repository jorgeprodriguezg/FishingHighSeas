Provinces are extracted after applying Infomap to the network defined by the observed transitions between geographical locations, which include:
1. 0.5ยบ lat x 0.5ยบ lon grid cells located in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction with non-null fishing effort ("Fishing" column = 1).
2. Ports according to the World Port Index, include a port ("Fishing" column = 0). We consider that these ports are visited when we detect a location within the same 0.5 ยบ lat x 0.5ยบ lon grid cell.

Information about the provinces is included in the file provinces_metadata.csv, where acronyms stand for South Eastern Indian (SEI), Northern Seas (NS), Eastern Pacific (EP), SWI (South Western Indian), North Western Pacific (NWP), Central Atlantic (CA), Northern Central Pacific (NCP), North Eastern Pacific (NEP), Southern Pacific (SP), South Eastern Atlantic (SEA), Northern Indian (NI), Southern Atlantic (SA), Southern Central Pacific (SCP) and Northern Atlantic (NA).
