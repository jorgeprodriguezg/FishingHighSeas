Provinces are extracted after applying Infomap to the network defined by the observed transitions between geographical locations, which include:
1. 0.5ยบ lat x 0.5ยบ lon grid cells located in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction with non-null fishing effort ("Fishing" column = 1).
2. Ports according to the World Port Index, include a port ("Fishing" column = 0). We consider that these ports are visited when we detect a location within the same 0.5 ยบ lat x 0.5ยบ lon grid cell.
Information about the provinces is included in the file metadata.dat
